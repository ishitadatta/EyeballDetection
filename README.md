# EyeballDetection
Eye detection and tracking has been an active research field in the past years as it adds convenience to a variety of applications. Eye-gaze tracking is been considered as untraditional method of Human Computer Interaction. Eye tracking is considered as the easiest alternative interface methods. For eye tracking and eye detection several different approaches have been proposed and used to implement different algorithms for these technologies. Generally, an eye tracking and detection system can be divided into four steps: Face detection, eye region detection, pupil detection and eye tracking.
